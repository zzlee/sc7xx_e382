# Gemini Code Assistant Report

## Project Overview

This project is a Xilinx Vivado FPGA design named `sc7xx`. The design appears to be centered around a PCIe interface, likely for data acquisition or processing. It utilizes AXI-Stream interfaces for high-speed data transfer and includes custom modules for control and interrupt handling.

The top-level module is `sc7xx_top`, which instantiates a Vivado block design. The block design itself is defined in the `sc7xx.tcl` script and includes several IP cores and custom Verilog modules.

### Key Technologies

*   **FPGA:** Xilinx Artix-7 (xc7a50tcsg325-2)
*   **EDA Tool:** Xilinx Vivado 2024.2
*   **HDL:** Verilog, SystemVerilog
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   PCIe
    *   AXI-Stream
    *   AXI-Lite

### Architecture

The design consists of a Vivado block design that connects several IP cores and custom Verilog modules. The key components are:

*   **`xdma`:** Xilinx DMA for PCIe, which provides high-speed data transfer between the host and the FPGA.
*   **`axi_interconnect`:** Connects the AXI-Lite master to various slave modules.
*   **`axis_src` and `axis_sink`:** Custom modules for generating and receiving AXI-Stream data.
*   **`generic_ctrl`:** A generic control module with an AXI-Lite interface.
*   **`user_intr`:** A module for handling user interrupts.
*   **`zzlab_env_ctrl`:** A module for controlling the environment and providing status information.

## Building and Running

To build and work with this project, you will need Xilinx Vivado 2024.2.

1.  **Open Vivado:** Launch the Vivado IDE.
2.  **Source the Tcl script:** In the Tcl Console, navigate to the project's root directory and source the `sc7xx.tcl` script:

    ```tcl
    cd /home/zzlee/sc7xx_e382
    source sc7xx.tcl
    ```

3.  **Run Synthesis and Implementation:** Once the project is open, you can run synthesis and implementation by clicking the "Run Synthesis" and "Run Implementation" buttons in the Flow Navigator.

## Development Conventions

*   The project follows a standard Vivado project structure.
*   Source files are located in `sc7xx/sc7xx.srcs/sources_1/new`.
*   Constraints are in `sc7xx/sc7xx.srcs/constrs_1/new`.
*   The top-level module is `sc7xx_top`.
*   The design uses a block design approach, with most of the logic contained within the `sc7xx.bd` file.
